I feel depressed. I don't know what's been going on the past day. I have an issue with getting distracted by social media, I was thinking about what to post for my game, I was having self-doubt, I procrastinated and kept getting unfocused and distracted, I wasted the day, I lacked self-control and checked social media regardless for fear of missing out, and now I'm here, with Godot engine open on my computer, just playing around with the project so far, and.... it was depressing, I am bored, I am depressed, I don't feel I have ideas to continue this project, 

I'm not making any progress after I posted the second promo, I dont think I'm only struggling with motivation, I'm also struggling with mental health,

I haven't been happy

I'm still distracted

I'm unmotivated

I feel depressed

I initially made this txt file to write down current issues with the current code so I can improve them, but I couldn't do it, I can't,

I can't do this

I've been struggling

I'm not happy, there's something wrong

I feel depressed
